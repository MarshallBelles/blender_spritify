------------------------------ OLD Description ------------------------------
Spritify

When an animation render is complete, all of the frames in the animation are
compiled into a single spritesheet usable for sprite-based games.

There is a Spritify panel in Render Properties where you configure some of the
attributes of the sprite sheet as well as enable/disable the ability to
automatically generate a sprite sheet each time an animation render completes.

As of version 0.4.0, Spritify will also optionally generate an animated GIF.

Originally developed for use in the Ancient Beast (http://www.ancientbeast.com/)
project.
